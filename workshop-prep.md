# RevBayes Workshop Preparation

## Statistics

RevBayes performs statistical phylogenetic analysis. For this workshop, you need to understand the basic principles of statistical analysis and probability, especially Bayesian statistics. Here is a brief tutorial that conveys the basic ideas:

## Using the Shell

RevBayes is started from the command line. Try using the command prompt and familiarize yourself with the following commands:

* cd
* pwd
* ls
* mkdir

Try this simple Unix tutorial if you need more guidance: [http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/](http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/)


## Using R for Statistics

RevBayes is designed to be very similar to R. Additionally, some of the visualization of the output from RevBayes will be displayed using R. Hence, some brief familiarity with R is required.

## Bayesian Phylogenetics

RevBayes performs statistical phylogenetic analysis. You should familiarize yourself a little with the basic ideas behind Bayesian phylogenetics. Here are three great papers that should introduce you to the topic if you are not familiar yet.

* [Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny and Its Impact on Evolutionary Biology](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5550/2310)
* [Potential Applications and Pitfalls of Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/51/5/673/1678428/Potential-Applications-and-Pitfalls-of-Bayesian)
* [Phylogeny estimation: traditional and Bayesian approaches](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v4/n4/abs/nrg1044.html)

## Accessory Software

The RevBayes workshops will also use additional software for analysis of output and summarization of the MCMC. Please download and install the following:

* RevGadgets ([https://github.com/revbayes/RevGadgets](https://github.com/revbayes/RevGadgets))
* Tracer ([http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/))
* FigTree ([http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/))
* IcyTree (a web-based tree viewer; [http://tgvaughan.github.io/icytree/](http://tgvaughan.github.io/icytree))
* Text editors
	* Mac OSX: [Atom](https://atom.io/), [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
	* Windows: [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
	* Linux: [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Geany](https://www.geany.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## RevBayes Basics

To ease the transition into the workshop, some very little first exposure to RevBayes will help. Get started by installing RevBayes and try the very first tutorials so that you know how RevBayes looks.
